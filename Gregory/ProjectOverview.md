### Do you live in a food desert?

According to the USDA, a food desert is defined as an area where people have limited access to a variety of healthy foods. Some of the contributing factors to food deserts are low income, high poverty rates or having to travel farther to find healthy food.

The purpose of this project is to explore the characteristics of areas considered food deserts based on data obtained from the USDA Food Environment Atlas and to predict if an area will become a food desert. In order to meet our objective, we had to first understand the data and define the data points that would be used. The data provided is broken down by census tract for each county within a state. A census tract is a defined area within a county with an average population of 4000 inhabitants. For each census tract the following data is provided:

路     Poverty rate

路     Median Family Income

路     Low-income neighborhoods

路     Low-access tracts measured at 1-to-10 miles.

We used the above data points to program our machine learning to predict if a food desert exists within a given area of a census tract. The results of our findings are in the project work tab. 

We created several tableau visualizations to show where the highest concentrations of food deserts are. The correlation between poverty, population and how they contribute to an area becoming a food desert.
